use base64 encode password in host.cfg file
host.cfg eg:

[xcm_frame]
domain = domain1
host = 192.168.1.2
port = 22
user = root
password = cm9vdDEyMwo=
workdir = /root


Note: the config file(CONFIG_FILE) is rather ../bak/host.cfg or ./host.cfg
if ../bak/host.cfg not exists means that CONFIG_FILE is ./host.cfg is under the corrent folder

use base64 encode password to modify password in CONFIG_FILE

use command set(uncrypted mode)/enset(encrypted mode) to config the CONFIG_FILE
localhost all  remote shell#set
Config the host file:/Users/xiaogui/WorkSpace/code/remoting_login/quick_deploy_toolkit/../bak/host.cfg
input your host_no: host_eg
input your domain: domain_eg
input your host: 10.19.88.79
input your port: 22
input your user: user_eg
input your password: passwd_eg
keep server alive second: 30
input your workdir: home/work
[host_eg]
domain = domain_eg
host = 10.19.88.79
port = 22
user = user_eg
password = cGFzc3dkX2Vn
serveraliveinterval = 30
workdir = home/work
confirm the config to be saved.(y/n):y

use rmhost command to remove host in CONFIG_FILE by host_no
use vl commnad to edit CONFIG_FILE
use lang command to set lang
